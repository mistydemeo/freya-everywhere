Freya everywhere!
=================

This is a set of terminal colour schemes themed after [Freya][freya], my favourite vim colour scheme. It's a lovely dark scheme with warm, low-contrast colours that looks like this:

This repository contains a couple of terminal themes I've created using Freya colours, hopefully with more to come. Currently available:

* Terminal.app (Snow Leopard and Lion)
* iTerm 2
* Sublime Text / TextMate

Notes
-----

* The Snow Leopard Terminal.app theme only works using [TotalTerminal](http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/). The original Terminal.app doesn't support customizing ANSI colours.
